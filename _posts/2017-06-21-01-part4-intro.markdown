In Part 4, we'll add an *end-to-end* (e2e) testing solution, *form validation* to the React app, a *Swagger* service to document the API, and deal with some tech debt. We'll also set up a staging environment to test on before the app goes into production.

#### Objectives

By the end of part 4, you should be able to...

1. Test the entire set of services with functional, end-to-end tests via TestCafe
1. Integrate TestCafe into a continuous integration process
1. Handle form validation within React
1. Add a flash messaging system to the React app
1. Describe the purpose of Swagger
1. Generate a Swagger Spec based on an existing RESTful API
1. Configure Swagger to interact with a service running inside a Docker Container
1. Set up a staging environment on AWS

#### App

<div style="text-align:left;">

</div>

Check out the live app, running on EC2 -

1. Main app - http://54.89.0.180/
1. Swagger - http://54.89.0.180:8080

You can also test out the following endpoints...

| /auth/status    | GET         | Yes             | check user status |
| /users          | GET         | No              | get all users     |
